The central research question is: \"How effectively can sensor data and simulation models be integrated to enhance the real-time control and autonomy of a hybrid robotic system?\" The experiment involves using the UR5 to position the quadruped at a designated start point, triggering the quadruped to run in a specified direction, and collecting sensor data during its motion. We then broadcast this data to a server for analysis, comparing it with simulated data. The refined simulation results are subsequently applied back to the robot to evaluate improvements in performance forming a closed loop.</p> <p>Figure 1: High-Level System Concept Figure 1 illustrates the flow from UR5 positioning, quadruped movement, sensor data collection, data analysis, simulation refinement, and back to robotic control.</p>"},{"location":"#32-sensor-integration","title":"3.2 Sensor Integration","text":"<p>Sensor integration is critical to our experimental setup. We plan to collect a range of sensor data (e.g., IMU, LIDAR, joint encoders) during the quadruped\u2019s run. This data will be processed and filtered in real time to remove noise and extract meaningful features. In testing, sensors will validate both the starting position and the dynamic state of the quadruped. In the final demonstration, real-time sensor feedback will be used to adjust simulation parameters and fine-tune control algorithms, ensuring the robot operates optimally even under environmental variations.</p>"},{"location":"#33-interaction-and-interface-development","title":"3.3 Interaction and Interface Development","text":"<p>Interaction with the system will be two-fold: 1.
